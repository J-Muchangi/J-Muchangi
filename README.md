## 🚀 About Me & My Focus

I'm currently a graduate student deepening my expertise in **Machine Learning** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** to transition into an ML Engineering.

-   🧠 **Current Learning Focus:** Deep Learning (CNNs, Sequential Models/NLP) and applying DSA principles (Big-O analysis) to my code.
-   🛠️ **Goal:** To convert theoretical knowledge from Coursera and relevant course work into practical, independently coded, and well-documented projects.
-   📍 **Available For:** Collaboration on ML projects, open-source contributions, and networking!

## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools

I rely on Python's robust ecosystem for data science and machine learning, and am focused on building clean, efficient code.

| Category | Tools & Libraries |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core ML/DS** | Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQL |
| **Deep Learning** | PyTorch / TensorFlow, CNNs, RNNs, VLms |
| **Version Control** | Git, GitHub |
| **Deployment/Concepts** | Docker, MLOps (in progress) |

## 📌 Featured Projects

These are my current focus areas, demonstrating the **end-to-end ML lifecycle** from data cleaning to model evaluation. *(I will replace these placeholders with actual repo links soon!)*

1.  **ML-Foundations-NumPy**
    * *Goal:* Implementing core algorithms (like Logistic Regression) from scratch using NumPy to master the underlying math.
2.  **DSA-Practice-Python**
    * *Goal:* Daily practice of fundamental Data Structures & Algorithms (Arrays, Hash Maps, Trees) with a focus on optimal complexity.
3.  **Explainable AI for Alzheimers Detection**
    * *Goal:* A Machine Learning Project to help in explaining Alzheimers disease given descriptive data.

## 🌱 My Current Learning Discipline

My primary focus is on consistency and independence (coding without full reliance on AI/tutorials). You'll see a steady stream of commits here for:

-   Completing one DSA problem (Medium difficulty) 3x a week.
-   Pushing code changes for my primary ML project daily/weekly.
